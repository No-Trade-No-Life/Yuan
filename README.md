## Motivation

In the early stages of our quantitative trading endeavors, after extensively searching and researching various existing quantitative trading frameworks and products, we found that none could fully meet the development and research needs of our unique trading strategies. Thus, undeterred by the challenges, we embarked on creating our own product, Yuan, driven by our specific requirements.

Our basic requirements are:

1. **Strong Privacy Security**

   Quantitative model code is the core asset of users and is at risk of being stolen. Many products on the market require uploading strategy code to servers, and these products can fully evaluate and steal the code as long as they have the user's code. If the user's strategy can be grasped by potential competitors, the user will be at a disadvantage. Therefore, there are also some products on the market that allow private deployment. We have designed a local workspace for users to ensure that their privacy is protected from being stolen by anyone, including the Yuan project team. Additionally, we have completed open-source, subject to the supervision of the open-source community, and will not do anything in the code that harms the interests of users.

2. **Full Market Compatibility**

   Users invest and trade in different markets. We hope that the same strategy code can be applied to different market varieties, both for historical backtesting and real-time trading, without any additional cost. We also hope that the platform product can support various types of markets. However, due to regional laws and regulations and some business restrictions, products on the market usually only support a part of the markets, forcing users to use different platforms in different markets. Through architectural design, we decouple specific market modules, not only improving software quality but also overcoming compliance obstacles, paving the way for the globalization of the product.

3. **Cross-Platform Compatibility**

   We hope that our product can run without restrictions on any device on any platform, whether on desktop or mobile. After all, the market does not care about the user's situation. Users can switch to work and interact with the market at any time in any scenario.

4. **Low Cost and High Scalability**

   Industry initial licensing fees often reach thousands, not to mention the high additional and maintenance costs. We believe that these costs are partly due to bundling sales to offset development costs, partly due to inefficiency, and partly due to the desire to profit. As a product aimed at individual investors rather than enterprises, we must consider the consumption ability of ordinary investors. For investors, the most important aspect of tools is cheap and durable. Whether on personal computers or server clusters, our product can run effectively.
   Yuan is an investment operating system designed to empower you to master your finances.

### Why use Yuan

**Powerful Web GUI**

With Yuan Web GUI, you have access to a comprehensive solution for creating, testing, and managing your trading system, as well as deploying and monitoring your applications. The GUI is completely open-source and can be deployed anywhere, without an internet connection. You can easily switch between multiple environments using just one GUI, making your experience more streamlined.

We have designed the GUI with modern browsers in mind, and it integrates with the latest web technologies, such as WebWorker, FileSystemHandle, WebRTC, and more. It is highly responsive and fast, and we are constantly working to make it even better for you.

Although the GUI is currently written in Chinese, we have plans to make it internationalized, so you can use it in your native language in the future. We welcome contributions to the project's translation, so everyone can benefit from this amazing tool. You can access the GUI for free under the MIT license, without the need to install anything - simply use the [GUI](https://y.ntnl.io).

**Simple language and AI assistant**

If you're interested in developing a trading strategy without the need to learn a new language or DSL, the modern JavaScript/TypeScript language is an excellent option. You can use any IDE to write your code and any version control system to manage it. If you have difficulty with coding, you can seek assistance from an AI assistant by communicating your idea to it.

```ts
// It's a simple trend-tracking trading strategy that uses the SMA indicator.
import { useSMA, useSimplePositionManager } from '@libs';
export default () => {
  const { close } = useOHLC('Y', 'XAUUSD', 'PT1H');
  const ma20 = useSMA(close, 20);
  const accountInfo = useAccountInfo();
  const [targetVolume, setTargetVolume] = useSimplePositionManager(accountInfo.account_id, 'XAUUSD');
  useEffect(() => {
    const idx = close.length - 2;
    if (close[idx] > ma20[idx]) {
      setTargetVolume(1);
    } else {
      setTargetVolume(0);
    }
  }, [close.length]);
};
```

More examples can be found [here](https://github.com/No-Trade-No-Life/Yuan-Public-Workspace).

**Local, cloud...or hybrid!**

Yuan is a hybrid-cloud software that allows you to deploy your trading system in your home or public cloud simultaneously. You can start using your home PC and then gradually switch to the public cloud as your business grows. Choosing between your home PC or the public cloud will depend on your availability, costs, privacy, and security requirements.

**Extension-first Ecosystem**

In Yuan, extensions are treated as first-class citizens. Many core features are built and distributed as extensions. You can use extensions to add new features, connect with more markets, and enhance your experience. You can download extensions from the community or create your own extensions to share with others.

## Getting started (for developers) üöÄ

Prerequisites: `nodejs >= 22.14.0`, [docker](https://www.docker.com/) for image build, and [rush](https://rushjs.io/) for mono repo management.

```bash
npm install -g @microsoft/rush
```

Then you can install dependencies and build projects

```bash
rush update && rush build
```

If you have no docker installed, you can skip the docker build by setting the environment variable `CI_RUN` to `true`.

```bash
CI_RUN=true rush build
```

### Packages

#### RPC Framework

Yuan implements communication between terminals in a distributed system through an RPC framework. It natively supports both browser and NodeJS environments. It uses a star topology where all terminals connect to a central Host node. Terminals can send messages to other terminals via the Host, which is responsible for message forwarding. Meanwhile, terminals utilize WebRTC to establish peer-to-peer connections for more efficient communication, reducing the Host's load. The Host acts as a signaling service to facilitate P2P connection establishment.

- [@yuants/protocol](libraries/protocol) Network protocols, service definitions, and infrastructure.
- [@yuants/app-host](apps/host) Host is a lightweight message broker. Terminals can connect to the Host and send messages to each other. Note that all terminals in a Host should trust each other. In practice, all terminals within a Host belong to the same owner. There's no need to verify each message. You can deploy multiple Hosts to isolate risks.
- [@yuants/app-hosts](apps/hosts) A lightweight host cluster that can handle message forwarding for multiple hosts within a single process. No pre-registration of host token tables is required - it automatically accepts terminals with valid ED25519 signatures without needing to send private keys. Ideal for multi-tenant environments and scenarios requiring low-cost creation of multiple hosts.
- [@yuants/host-manager](libraries/host-manager) The underlying abstraction for Hosts, enabling programmatic management of multiple isolated Hosts. Provides simple APIs for creation, deletion, and management. Useful for creating multi-tenant environments or isolating different business units.
- [@yuants/app-portal](apps/portal) Deploys a service that shares existing services (and channels) from one Host to others. Acts as an intermediary to forward messages between Hosts. A powerful tool for building data sharing scenarios.

#### Storage

Yuan uses PostgreSQL for general-purpose scenarios, Prometheus for telemetry metrics, and Redis for cached data.

##### Databases

Due to SQL complexity and significant variations between SQL databases, complex SQL statements are often incompatible. We default to only ensuring compatibility with PostgreSQL, sometimes requiring specific extensions (e.g., TimeScale DB).

- [@yuants/postgres-storage](apps/postgres-storage) A PostgreSQL storage service that connects PostgreSQL instances to Host services while hiding connection credentials.
- [@yuants/sql](libraries/sql) Client-side SQL library providing convenient read/write capabilities for PostgreSQL data in Hosts.

##### Telemetry

We plan to adopt OpenTelemetry as the telemetry standard while continuing to use Prometheus for metric storage.

- [@yuants/app-metrics-collector](apps/metrics-collector) Deploys a terminal as a metrics collection service, continuously gathering metrics from terminals. Works with Prometheus.
- [@yuants/prometheus-client](libraries/prometheus-client) Prometheus client for browser/Node, outperforming `promjs`.
- [@yuants/app-prometheus-client](apps/prometheus-client) Deploys a terminal as a Prometheus client service for querying Prometheus data, ideal for building monitoring dashboards.

#### Data Modeling

To unify global markets, we need a universal data model to represent market data. This data model facilitates data conversion and mapping across different markets.

The data modeling includes TypeScript types and SQL table definitions.

- [@yuants/data-product](libraries/data-product) Tradable products in markets.
- [@yuants/data-ohlc](libraries/data-ohlc) OHLC(V) data (Open, High, Low, Close with optional Volume) - a common market data format also known as candlestick charts.
- [@yuants/data-interest-rate](libraries/data-interest-rate) Interest rate data. Interest refers to the charges incurred when traders hold positions through settlement points. It's commonly used in forex trading and CFD (Contract for Difference) trading, and also applies to funding rates in perpetual contracts.

Legacy data models are maintained in [@yuants/data-model](libraries/data-model). We plan to split them into multiple specialized packages to reduce impact from non-core model changes.

Additionally, private data models that don't need to be shared between packages will be kept within their respective domain-specific packages.

We have identified two particularly useful properties of data: hierarchical structure and time-series nature.

**Hierarchical Structure**  
For example, product hierarchies stem from different markets and various asset categories. Account information hierarchies originate from different brokers, parent-child account relationships, fund component structures, etc. Hierarchical properties enable us to store and manage vast amounts of data efficiently. The hierarchical nature also provides intuitive understanding - we only need to work within a specific subdirectory at any time.

**Time-Series Nature**  
Data is typically generated chronologically and continuously aggregated by time periods. Taking OHLC data as an example, we can leverage time-series characteristics for data management across different time slices. For instance, we can periodically fetch data from providers and store it in databases. Time-series data offers highly efficient storage and query performance.

#### Data Collection

For relatively static data, we can retrieve it through data providers' APIs and store it in databases.

For time-series data, we need to periodically fetch data from providers and store it in databases.

We've defined constraints that time-series data should satisfy: [@yuants/data-series](libraries/data-series) - A generic time-series data model that defines fundamental properties and methods. Data service providers can use this to create their own time-series models and quickly implement data collection tasks.

We've introduced a time-series data collection scheduler: [@yuants/series-collector](apps/series-collector) - A universal time-series data collector that uses CronJob scheduled tasks to fetch data from various providers and store it in databases. Simply add a record to the `series_collecting_task` table in the database, and the collector will automatically fetch and store the data periodically.

#### Service Providers

Service providers act as connectors to external systems that interact with Yuan. These systems operate independently and generate new data autonomously.

Providers proxy requests/responses to external systems, which may include exchanges, data sources, or other external services. They store data locally and communicate with other terminals via the RPC framework.

Providers encompass exchanges, data sources, or any external data/services. Yuan's capabilities expand as more providers are added.

Access global markets through various providers. Each provider serves as a direct gateway to external services. Private data (account info, market data) isn't stored in Yuan cloud services - you can deploy providers on your own cloud or local machines. Data remains exclusively in your Host's storage.

- [@yuants/vendor-ctp](apps/vendor-ctp) Connects to the "Comprehensive Transaction Platform" (CTP) developed by Shanghai Futures Exchange (SHFE) for Chinese futures trading. Regulatory compliance may require broker permissions.

- [@yuants/app-alert-receiver](apps/alert-receiver) Deploys an alert reception service that forwards alerts to notification terminals.

#### Agent

An Agent is a trading bot/strategy program that can automatically execute trading strategies and make decisions based on market data and account information. Agents can backtest on historical data or perform live trading with real-time data. You can customize an Agent's behavior and strategies.

- [@yuants/kernel](libraries/kernel) Provides a time-series simulation environment that can be combined with modules for different purposes.
- [@yuants/agent](libraries/agent) A Kernel-based trading bot containing the core trading strategy logic.
- [@yuants/app-agent](apps/agent) Deploys a standalone terminal as an Agent daemon service. You can run Agents in **live mode**, which automatically corrects historical data errors and restarts Agents after crashes.

#### Trade Execution

In the trade execution phase, we use an execution engine to convert an Agent's simulated positions into actual trading orders. The execution engine sends these orders to exchanges or other trading platforms.

- [@yuants/app-trade-copier](apps/trade-copier) Deploys a terminal as a trade copying service that monitors source accounts and ensures target accounts mirror them.

For multiple accounts, a transfer controller handles inter-account fund movements:

- [@yuants/app-transfer-controller](apps/transfer-controller) A service that monitors transfer requests and ensures completion of inter-account transfers.

You can even build a logistics network to automatically balance funds between accounts according to strategies:

- [@yuants/app-risk-manager](apps/risk-manager) Deploys a terminal as a risk management service that makes transfer decisions based on configured risk parameters.

#### Utilities

- [@yuants/utils](libraries/utils) General utilities not found in community packages.

#### Web UI

[@yuants/ui-web](ui/web), you can directly access https://y.ntnl.io to access the Yuan GUI.

The graphical user interface (GUI) is the most widely used human-computer interaction interface today. It can do everything that command-line interfaces (CLI), natural language interfaces (NUI, LUI), and other interfaces can do.

- **Single-line Deployment**: All users use the same, latest version of the GUI.
- **Strong Privacy**: The content of the workspace used by the GUI is completely confidential.
- **Extensibility**: You can install extensions to enhance your workspace.
- **Multi-device Adaptation**: Any device with a modern browser can access the GUI and its features. We will continuously improve multi-device adaptability.
- **PWA Support**: The GUI can be installed as a desktop application via PWA. Mobile devices can also use PWA to install to the home screen.

#### Distributions

Yuan is a powerful operating system, but it is also too low-level, primitive, and difficult to use. Only tech-savvy users can handle it, and it is not suitable for direct use by ordinary users.

For different user scenarios, it is best to provide specific distributions that are pre-configured with some features so that users can use them directly.

Below are some distributions we provide as references. You can create your own distributions based on your needs.

- [@yuants/dist-origin](distributions/origin): Native distribution [Click to experience online](https://y.ntnl.io?from_npm=1&scope=yuants&name=dist-origin)

##### Creating a Distribution

The essence of a distribution is a workspace, and the essence of a workspace is a file directory and its contents. We can package the workspace into a distribution, and then users can download and unzip it to use. We recommend using the npm package management tool to manage distributions, i.e., distributions will be published to the npm repository, and users can install distributions via npm.

In the Web GUI's address parameters, we can specify installing the distribution from npm using the `from_npm` parameter. For example, `https://y.ntnl.io?from_npm=1&scope=yuants&name=dist-origin`.

**URL Parameters**:

- `from_npm`: Whether to install the distribution from npm. `1` for yes, leave empty for no.
- `scope`: The scope of the npm package, optional parameter.
- `name`: The name of the npm package, required parameter.
- `version`: The version of the npm package, in the format of a [semver](https://semver.org/) compliant version range, optional parameter. Defaults to the latest version.

```
// Install the latest version of the @yuants/dist-origin distribution
https://y.ntnl.io?from_npm=1&scope=yuants&name=dist-origin

// Install a specific version (0.0.2) of the @yuants/dist-origin distribution
https://y.ntnl.io?from_npm=1&scope=yuants&name=dist-origin&version=0.0.2

// Install a specific version (>=0.0.2) of the @yuants/dist-origin distribution
https://y.ntnl.io?from_npm=1&scope=yuants&name=dist-origin&version=>=0.0.2
```

#### Documents

[@yuants/docs](ui/docs) is the document of Yuan.

It's built by [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/). You can find the latest documents [here](https://www.ntnl.io/).

#### Toolkit

[@yuants/tool-kit](tools/toolkit) is all you need. This provides a CLI when you need to build an extension. It helps you to build a docker image, create a bundle and more. To ensure your extension is ready to use.
